Share that bill
=================

THIS REPOSITORY IS FOR AN ACADEMIC PROJECT FOR THE MOBILE APPLICATION PROGRAMMING COURSE ON SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY - FALL 2014

Audience: people who travel or share house expenses with friends
When you go to travel with some friends and want to share your expenses fairly
between everyone it’s really hard to split every penny on stores or, even worse, use
spreadsheets to keep track of what each one has paid/has to pay. That’s where Share
That Bill comes in hand.

The users of the app will have a login account, which can be a Facebook account,
for example. It will be possible for users to create groups with other users. The users has to
accept an invite to be part of the group. These groups will represent an activity they made
together that they want to share the expenses.

When an user is in a group, for example the group called “California Trip June
2014”, it will be possible to add an expense (here called bill) to the group. This bill will store
basic information, such as the place/date it took place, and also how much each person of
the group has contributed to pay it and with whom it will be shared.

For example, in this trip there are 4 people, named A, B, C and D. The first 3 went
to a bar on that trip, while the other one was the driver. The person C paid the bill. Later, C
will register the amount he paid, where/when it was and who should share that bill with him
(A and B only).

Using the app, the 4 folks will be able to know at a given time who has spent more
money and who has spend less. This way they will be able to spend money more evenly.
After each modification on the amount of bills, like adding an expense for someone or
removing someone from the share, the user who made the modification has the option to
send an email or notification to every other user on the group. This way, the users will ever
know when someone modifies the bill amount.

The users will be able to upload a picture of the receipt of a bill to the group, so
everyone can see the proof of the expense. At the moment of the creation of a bill, the user
will be able to take a picture of the receipt with his phone. Also, the user location will be
added to the picture information from the cellphone's GPS.
In the end of the trip, the app will distribute their debts and credits, so who has paid
less than he should will pay someone who has paid more than he had to.

Services used by the app:
camera, service, email, service, database, access, web, service, login via facebook account stored on device, mapping, services. 

The user data, as well, groups and bills will be stored on an online database.
